If a company decides to pass any resolution by resorting to postal ballot, it will send a notice to all the shareholders, requesting them to send their assent or dissent in writing on a postal ballot. The process&mdash;of seeking shareholders&#39; approval through postal ballot&mdash;is not only time consuming but also involves huge cost such as administration and posting costs, paper work, etc. To avoid all these hassles, the new Companies Act 2013, has introduced the concept of voting through electronic means.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">E-voting is a common Internet Infrastructure that enables the investors to vote electronically on resolution of companies. Electronic voting replaces the postal ballot process and saves time and cost of the company. e-Voting is a mechanism through which security holders of companies can vote on resolutions electronically any-where and at any-time during the period of voting, through the electronic voting system developed by NSDL and CDSL. In case of e-voting, there is no physical collection and counting of postal ballot papers. Also, there is no need for verification of signatures of the shareholders who have exercised their votes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">e-voting platform service agencies:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to solve the problems faced with the postal ballot, NSDL and CDSL have developed an internet based e-voting platform which enables shareholders to vote electronically in a convenient manner. &#39;User ID&#39; and &#39;Password&#39; are provided to the shareholders by the agency providing e-voting platform. In case of joint shareholding, e-voting option will be available only to the first shareholder. E-voting facility is available to shareholders holding shares in physical form as well as in demat form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Electronic voting system:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to Companies Act 2013, every listed company or a company having at least 1,000 shareholders should provide to its members the facility to exercise their right to vote at general meetings by electronic means. Section 108 of the Companies Act, 2013 deals with the voting through electronic means. E-voting system records votes of the members / shareholders of a company. It also provides data on the number of votes polled in favour or against a resolution proposed by the company. e-voting process is safe and maintains the confidential of the data.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Process of e-voting for a company:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A company desiring to use the e-Voting system has to sign the agreement and accept the terms and conditions for usage of the e-Voting system with CDSL.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The notice of the meeting should mention that the business may be transacted through electronic voting system and the company is providing facility for voting by electronic means.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The company through its Register and Transfer Agent (RTA) will set up the e-voting schedule on its website. The company will upload the resolutions on which voting is required and generate an Electronic Voting Sequence Number (EVSN) / Electronic Voting Even Number (EVEN). The Company will upload the Register of Members.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">CDSL / NSDL will generate the password for each shareholder and print the same in a secured manner, which is to be sent to all the shareholders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The company will then communicate the password, EVSN /EVEN and the procedure for e-voting along with the notice of resolution to all the shareholders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the end of the voting period, the portal where votes are cast will be blocked and no additional votes will be accepted by the company.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the voting period is over, a scrutiniser prepares a report of the votes cast in favour or against, if any, forthwith to the Chairman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A scrutiniser is an individual who monitors the entire process of e-voting. Appointed by the company, a scrutinizer, may be a practising chartered accountant, cost accountant, company secretary or an advocate.

Okay, not you precisely, because that would be a bit silly. But what if you had a replica version of yourself that could earn like you and make money like you. Wouldn&rsquo;t you jump on that opportunity? Or maybe pay an annual fee just so you could hold on to this person? You probably would. And a term insurance product does just that. It is your financial replica and it comes alive when you die.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Let me explain. When you buy a term insurance product, you pay a small fee every year to protect your downside. And in the event of your passing, the insurance company pays out a large sum of money to your family or your loved ones. Think &mdash; 1 Crore or 5 Crore or even 10 Crore. Ideally, this money should replace you financially. It should support your family when you&rsquo;re no longer the breadwinner. And unless you&rsquo;ve deliberately misled your insurer whilst buying the policy, they will pay out the full amount the moment you die. Hell, even if you do mislead them, they have 3 years to uncover the fraud. If they don&rsquo;t do it by then, they are mandated to pay out, no questions asked. So unless you commit suicide within one year of buying the policy or you died while committing a crime, your loved ones will get this money.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>And while the base product is simple enough to understand, we&rsquo;ll address some of the</span><span><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://joinditto.in/term-insurance/checklist/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1709726652161743&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ShcLiJWW4nVYyphVA2zcg">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://joinditto.in/term-insurance/checklist/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1709726652161924&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-HcC0jCSWldAxTZu1_dEZ">key factors</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;affecting a term insurance purchase in the next section.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.dpu1mqqfwi2j"><span class="c8">What is an ideal cover for your Term policy?</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The first question should be obvious by now &mdash; How much money do you need to replace yourself financially?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a tough question and let&rsquo;s be honest &mdash; It is a bit subjective as well. But there are a few key things you have to remember here. For starters, your expenses. If your lifestyle demands a certain level of spending you will need to keep it up if you don&rsquo;t want your absence to be felt. So if you&rsquo;re spending 50,000 every month, your term insurance product should replace this income. And at that rate, you&rsquo;re probably looking at a cover totalling 1 Crore. Let me explain why.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Think about what your family would do if they received this money. Assume they do the least sophisticated thing possible &mdash; which is probably the smartest thing to do as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">Fixed Deposits!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">At 6% annually, they will receive 6 lakhs each year. That should adequately compensate for your lost income. However with inflation, that 6 lakhs might start looking paltry very soon. So let&rsquo;s try and beat inflation. Let&rsquo;s assume the insurer pays you 2 Crores. That should get your family 12 lakhs each year. A pretty good sum overall and maybe good enough for the next 10 years. But what if you have a lot of financial obligations? Loans and that sort of stuff.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Then you should start looking at a higher cover. And while these are rough estimates, I hope you get where I am going with this. The final amount should generate enough cash flows for a reasonable amount of time to pay for all your family expenses (including EMIs) and also leave a little extra for your family.

With a</span><span><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://joinditto.in/term-insurance/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1709726652162795&amp;usg=AOvVaw15BhNEWIDKAb_bcC6LA7aq">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://joinditto.in/term-insurance/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1709726652162890&amp;usg=AOvVaw05aAwa2a8pEVcAjP149ce-">term insurance</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;product, you keep paying your premiums until you die. Or the policy lapses. So there is an expiration date of sorts and it&rsquo;s on you to decide how long you want to keep your policy. And you have to make this choice at the time of purchase. You can&rsquo;t change it afterwards. So there&rsquo;s a lot riding on this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Once again, you are looking to replace yourself financially. But you are only doing it because &mdash; When you&rsquo;re young, your family won&rsquo;t have a lot of savings to fall back on. As you grow older, however, that changes. For instance, by 60, your kids will be all grown up. Your spouse will likely have a retirement fund to lean on and you won&rsquo;t have many dependents to worry about.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So 60 could be a good place to start. But the insurance company knows something. The average life expectancy in India is about 70. So if you are intending to keep the policy beyond 70, know that your premiums will shoot up. Like a lot. And that means the sweet spot is somewhere between 60 and 70. Any number in that range should ideally serve you well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And while this overview should help you understand term insurance, there are a few add-ons aka riders you can attach alongside the base policy to make sure your financial replacement is as robust as you. And the most useful rider of them all is a life stage benefit.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.vkcvcmt5mdb8"><span class="c8">How does a Life Stage Benefit help you?</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Term insurance policies are extremely rigid. You can&rsquo;t change your coverage once you sign the deal. If it was 1 Crore six years back, it will be 1 Crore until the policy expires. So if you buy a policy when you&rsquo;re young, your cover might be wholly inadequate in the future &mdash; when you marry and you have kids.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Unless you opted for a life-stage benefit. In which case, the insurer will offer you the option to increase your cover by a certain amount during major life events. For instance, when you get married and you have kids. It&rsquo;s this sort of flexibility that you need in a good term insurance policy. And so if you aren&rsquo;t married yet, maybe you should consider this benefit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If you think you will have more dependants in the future, opting for a life stage benefit is a no-brainer.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.yra6lp9oq0u3"><span class="c8">When the Insurer waives your premiums</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Imagine one day, the doctors tell you that you will be confined to a wheelchair permanently. It&rsquo;ll be devastating, I know. You will have to quit your job. You will have to figure out a way to make a living despite your condition and in the meantime, you will have to relook at your investments, prune your spending and maybe even drop your term insurance policy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">How are you going to pay 15,000 every year in premiums, eh?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That money could come in handy elsewhere. But what if it didn&rsquo;t have to be this way? What if the insurer allowed you to keep the policy even without paying your premium.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">See&hellip; Your condition is unique. You would have persisted with the policy if you hadn&rsquo;t been disabled. So some insurers will allow you to opt for a waiver. That&rsquo;s them telling you &mdash; Pay a small fee and you won&rsquo;t have to worry about your premiums in the event you are disabled. You can still keep your policy!!!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And while the waiver I just described kicks in if you are permanently disabled, you could also opt for a waiver if you are diagnosed with a critical illness &mdash; like Cancer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A waiver of premiums might not sound like much. But if you are permanently disabled or if you are forced to quit your job because of a critical illness, this benefit could be a lifesaver. So maybe you should actively consider both riders.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.4xfbgad3ygof"><span class="c8">Extra cover if you die in an accident?</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We have lax enforcement of traffic laws. We have terrible roads and poor street lights. We have reckless drivers and speeding motorists. And as a result, there&rsquo;s a fatal accident in this country every 4 minutes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And if you&rsquo;re worried about this statistic maybe it makes sense to opt for an accidental cover. In which case, the insurer pays out an additional 1 Crore to the family on top of the term cover (2 Cr.) if you died in an accident. And while these numbers are for illustrative purposes only, you can see how it can add an extra layer of security for your dependents, no?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If you pay a little bit extra alongside your base premium, your family could get some extra money and some extra protection in the event you die from an accident. But having said that, you must never reduce your term cover just because you have some protection here. That is a bad idea.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.j9yitt7xn8e2"><span class="c8">How a Critical Illness Benefit can help you?</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Critical illnesses like cancer are hard to deal with. Granted, your medical bills will be taken care of if you have an extremely comprehensive health insurance policy. But once diagnosed with a debilitating disease, you&rsquo;ll be forced to take a break. You won&rsquo;t be able to go to work. And your family will have to make do without your income.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But if you opt for a critical illness benefit, things won&rsquo;t have to be this grim. In the event, you are diagnosed with a critical illness, the insurer will pay out a portion of your term cover in cash to help you tide this crisis. It could be 10 lakhs. It could be 50 lakhs. It could be 1 Crore. All you have to do is choose the amount when opting for the benefit and you can use this money to replace your lost income if you are ever diagnosed with a critical illness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A critical illness rider will make your life so much easier. But remember &mdash; most policies will pay out the corpus from your sum insured. And your term cover will reduce by an equal amount.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.vcdwfoe7x6xy"><span class="c8">Should you opt for a Terminal Illness Benefit?</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The last thing you want to do with a terminal illness is &mdash; give up. When the doctor says you&rsquo;ve got 6 months to live, you don&rsquo;t begin counting your days. Instead, you look for avenues to survive. You&rsquo;d want to avail the best treatment in town. Maybe even go abroad. The only problem &mdash; It costs money. A lot of it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And if you opt for a terminal illness benefit, maybe you&rsquo;d have a recourse. See, some insurers will offer you the entire cover in cold hard cash the moment you&rsquo;re diagnosed with a terminal illness. That&rsquo;s them telling you &mdash; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re good as dead. So take the money.&rdquo; And with the large lump sum amount, maybe you&rsquo;ll have a chance to avail the best treatment doctors can offer you. And guess what? Even if you make it through and live past 6 months, the insurer won&rsquo;t ask you to pay them back.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">While this seems like a nice benefit to have, the likelihood of a doctor certifying a terminal illness and the insurer accepting the assessment isn&rsquo;t all that high. So maybe you should consider this fact before opting for this particular rider.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.uhiflm118ns2"><span class="c8">Can you beat inflation with increasing Cover?</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Term Insurance is weird. You pick a number &mdash; your total cover. The insurer promises to provide the said cover in case you die. And in return, you continue paying a premium every single year until that day comes. Or your paying term concludes. And while there is nothing peculiar about this arrangement in itself, think about the implications of your decision 15 years from now. A one crore cover might look paltry if you haven&rsquo;t taken inflation into account.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Which is why most people decide on the sum insured assuming inflation will continue to make ground each year.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But what if you didn&rsquo;t have to worry about all this while picking a cover. What if your sum insured grew by 5% or 10% each year? That would save you a whole lot of trouble. However, premiums for these plans are going to be much higher than your usual straight forward term insurance. After all, there is no free lunch in this world. So if you are looking to buy a term policy with an increasing cover each year, remember your premiums are 50 to 60 % higher as well. So it does make sense to take into account for inflation beforehand which we do help out with.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You could opt for this benefit or you could simply do the calculation right now and pick a larger cover that will protect against inflation. It&rsquo;s on you really.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.dt6wm1o74avm"><span class="c8">Should you decrease your cover as you grow older?</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Remember how I introduced term insurance as a product to replace you financially? Yeah, we need to revisit that. See, as you grow older, your dependents may no longer be as dependent on you as they once were. Your kids grow up. Your savings corpus increase in value. You will have enough money to cushion against any headwind. More importantly, your financial obligations will no longer look insurmountable.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Think about it. If you&rsquo;re a young lady with a home loan, you have to worry about paying your EMI each month. And in the off chance, you pass away, the burden shifts &mdash; to your spouse or even worse, your kids. So obviously you need better protection. You need a higher cover. But once you are through with the EMIs and your kids start working, maybe you won&rsquo;t need the same level of protection. Maybe replacing you financially won&rsquo;t be that big of a challenge. So some insurance companies offer you the option of decreasing your cover as you grow older. And that obviously means you will have also have to pay lower premiums as your cover diminishes in value.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">While this might be a feature some people would seek, it&rsquo;s very hard to predict future financial obligations. So if you are opting for this rider, make sure you are doubly sure you won&rsquo;t need a massive cover as you grow older.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Key factors to consider before buying a Term plan in India</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Before investing in a term insurance plan in India, you have to make sure you consider a few key factors to ensure you choose the right plan for your needs. And we&rsquo;ve written this expert guide to help you navigate the complexities of term insurance and make an informed decision</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This article is divided into two parts. You have insurer-specific features that tell you how to shortlist a life insurance company and policy-specific features that you may need while buying a term plan.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Insurer Specific Features</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Insurer specific features that tell you how to shortlist a life insurance company</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">1 Check the Claim Settlement Ratio</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When you&rsquo;re buying a term policy you want to make sure that the insurer is paying out your claims in a time bound manner. To do this, you need to check the claim settlement ratio averaged over 3 years and the proportion of claims paid out in under 30 days. If both numbers are above 97%, then you have a winner on your hands. And can find this information in IRDAI&rsquo;s annual reports or you could talk to our advisors.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">2 Check the Volume of Complaints</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If the total complaints received (per 10,000 claims registered) is higher than 20, then it&rsquo;s time to reconsider your insurer. You can find these figures in public disclosures as companies are liable to report this on their website. Or once again, you could talk to our advisors.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">3 You need a high amount settlement ratio too</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some insurers pay out the smaller claims while declining to pay out the few higher-value claims in a bid to improve the claim settlement ratio. So you will need to look at the total amount settled as a percentage of the total value claimed. A number above 90% should be good enough. You can find this information in IRDAI&rsquo;s annual reports or you could talk to our advisors. A number above 90% should be good enough.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Must have - Policy Specific Features</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In Policy-specific features we help you understand the must have and good to have features while buying a term plan.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">1 Critical Illness Benefit</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;re diagnosed with a debilitating disease, you might be at risk of losing your job and your family will have to make do without your income. However, if you opt for the critical illness benefit, the term policy will make a payout to deal with the crisis. Just remember that not all critical illness benefits are the same and you have to dig a little deeper.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Survival Period</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Payouts for critical illnesses usually aren&rsquo;t made immediately. Instead, most policies expect you to survive for a certain duration before they make the payment. So make sure to buy a policy that pays out this sum the moment the diagnosis is confirmed</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Accelerated Payout</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some policies will pay out the critical illness (CI) benefit from the total term cover available (Accelerated payout) while also offering you the option to avail it on top of the total term cover available. Ideally, you&rsquo;d want the policy to pay out the critical illness sum on top of the term cover available.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Waiting Periods</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Most policies impose a waiting period before they make the Critical Illness Benefit available. You want to make sure that the waiting period is less than 6 months.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">2 Accidental Death Benefit</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some policies offer you the option of adding extra protection for accidental deaths. In which case, you get the option of choosing your death and accidental death cover separately. And while we recommend customers choose a comprehensive cover without worrying about the specifics of death precisely, it&rsquo;s nice to have this option on top.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">3 Terminal Illness Benefit</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some policies will disburse the entire cover amount the moment you are diagnosed with a terminal illness. So even in the absence of death, you can still get the money and use it any way you wish. This is another benefit that&rsquo;s nice to have.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">4 Increasing Cover Benefit</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some policies automatically increase your cover by a certain amount (usually inflation) to always provide you with the necessary protection as you grow older. And you can check to see if your policy offers this benefit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Good to have - Policy Specific Features</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">1 Zero Cost Option</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some insurers will return all your premiums if you forego your policy before maturity, during a period specified by the insurer. So in essence, you get all your premiums back, while also being protected under the term plan during this time. Check to see if your policy offers this option and if the provision to exit the plan is convenient. You can talk to our advisors to know more.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">2 Waiver of Premium</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some policies waive all future premium payments if you are ever disabled or diagnosed with a critical illness. Ideally, you&rsquo;d want a policy that does this for both events.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Waiver of Premium</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">3 Top - Up</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some policies extend the option of increasing your cover at a later date, subject to a medical evaluation. And you definitely want a policy that extends this benefit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">4 Life Stage Benefit</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some policies extend the option of increasing your total term cover when you achieve significant life milestones i.e. when you get married, when you have kids etc. This is a nice add-on to have.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Will a single plan suffice? Yes. In most cases with good planning, one plan will suffice. However, in situations where your expenses and dependents increase substantially over the years along with your income, you may need to get another term plan.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Can I buy multiple-term plans? Yes, one can buy multiple-term plans. However, it should ideally be no more than 3 or 4 term plans as your dependents will have too many coordination points to get the policy claims. And this will become too tedious for them to manage.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Do you also need a rider? Some riders like Waiver of Premium rider or Return of Premium actually add immense value to the base policy. They give a significant boost to the sum assured under additional boundary conditions. Hence, term insurance riders should not be looked at as an additional non-value-adding item and should be evaluated in the context of one&rsquo;s lifestyle and requirements. However, though they add a nominal charge to the base plan premium, not all riders cater to your future financial goals.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Can the premiums change after a period in time? In term insurance, unlike health insurance, premiums once closed, do not change throughout the policy unless there are alterations in the sum assured.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">How does term insurance differ from life insurance? Life insurance has many variants like ULIP (Unit Linked Insurance Plan), Endowment plans, and Term Plans. Term Insurance is the variant that is considered pure life insurance. By pure life insurance, we mean plans whose only utility is to secure the financial future of the policyholder&rsquo;s dependant in case of his/her untimely demise. In such plans, there are no investment or return clauses/channels/aspects.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Should I declare myself a smoker if I don&#39;t smoke on a regular basis? Irrespective of the frequency of smoking, you should come clean with such declarations that may influence your health in the long run. Insurance companies underwrite applications and issue policies considering such factors. By declaring everything to the best of your knowledge &amp; abilities, you are ensuring that the dependents of the policy can get the benefits of the policy without the worry of rejection or lesser claim amount settlement than the pre-set coverage.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">What Are The Types Of Death Covered In Term Insurance? Term Insurance covers all scenarios including suicides. However, suicides have a waiting period of 1 year in most cases and the nominee has to submit the death certificate compulsorily to get the benefits.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Do I get any benefits if I survive the policy term? Pure-term insurance products do not have any survival benefits. However, there are riders like Return of Premium (ROP) that give you survival benefits against a minimum charge added to the base premium amount.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Health Insurance Guide</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Buying insurance is hard. Reading a policy document is even harder. And even if you make an effort to painstakingly go through this thing, you&rsquo;ll most likely draw a blank because you won&rsquo;t know what half those words mean. So in a bid to uncomplicate matters and teach you how to read a policy document, we&rsquo;ve created a set of simple case studies to explain what some of the most common terms and features actually mean. We will also tell you how they impact you and why you may or may not need them.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So let&rsquo;s start with the most ubiquitous feature within the health insurance checklist - Co-payment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Say no to Co-Payment?</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;re about to buy health insurance. The agent pitches a policy with a cover totaling 5 Lakhs for a bargain price of just &#8377;7000 a year. But then he sweetens the pot even further. He promises to cut down the premium by 25% (roughly &#8377;1800/year) if only you agree to a 20% co-payment clause. You think that&rsquo;s amazing and you sign off on the agreement. Wow, you just saved &#8377;1800.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">9 months later, you suffer an accident. You&rsquo;re hospitalized and you need extensive care. Thankfully you make a full recovery and the bill adds up to &#8377;2 Lakh. No problem. You&rsquo;ve got insurance. However, the insurer only pays &#8377;1,60,000. They ask you to pay the remaining &#8377;40,000 out of pocket since you promised to co-pay 20% of the bill.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You start doing the math. You saved &#8377;1,800 but you had to pay &#8377;40,000 because of the co-payment clause. It would take ~22 years worth of premium savings to make up for this fatal mistake. Not something you want in your insurance policy</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Co-payments almost never make sense unless they are mandatory or you&rsquo;re buying it for someone who&rsquo;s old with pre-existing diseases. In this case, a co-payment clause can bring down premiums on your health insurance plan drastically.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Check for restrictions on room &amp; room rent</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Imagine falling sick and finding out your insurer has a limit on room rent. You pick up the policy document begrudgingly and notice that that cap is set at 1% of your sum insured. 1% of &#8377;5 lakh insured is &#8377;5,000 each day. That&rsquo;s not a lot. And now you are upset you can&rsquo;t pick the room you wanted &mdash; one that costs &#8377;10,000 a day.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But you&rsquo;re fairly certain you won&rsquo;t be staying here for long. It&rsquo;s only going to be for a couple of days. And even if you pick the nicer room, you&rsquo;ll only have to pay the extra &#8377;10,000 (2 days*5000). So you choose the plush room anyway. However, 2 days later, you&rsquo;re discharged and the insurance company drops a bombshell.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;ll have to pay an extra &#8377;25,000. What?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, their carefully worded policy document notes that most services rendered in your room including surgeon fee, consultant fee, other diagnostic exams, etc will not be covered fully. Instead, they&#39;ll only pay a part of it because you picked a room that&#39;s too expensive.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">How much will they pay? Well, here&#39;s the math. The cap on room rent was fixed at &#8377;5,000, remember? Your actual room rent stood at &#8377;10,000. So they&#39;ll cover half your room rent and half the cost of all the services rendered in your room. For instance, if you have to undergo an operation and the surgeon&#39;s fee adds up to &#8377;50,000. They&#39;ll only pay &#8377;25,000. The rest is on you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Avoid policies with caps on room rent. It&rsquo;s that simple. If you still want to pursue this policy, make sure you pick a room that&rsquo;s well within the limit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Check for Disease Wise Sub-limits</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">10 lakh cover at a premium of just &#8377;6,000 a year. That&rsquo;s the offer in front of you. But instead of jumping for joy, you&rsquo;re suspecting something already. This guy is offering you a price that nobody else is matching. You are sceptical and you ponder for a while. But you go ahead with his recommendation anyway since he is a family friend of sorts.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And then, one day, your worst fears come true. A slipped disk forces you into the operation theatre. You require extensive treatment. The final bill is hefty. &#8377;4,36,000 &mdash; inclusive of all costs. But despite your 10 lakh cover the insurer tells you they can only cover &#8377;2,00,000. You are outraged and you press for a clarification.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Eventually, they tell you your policy has disease wise sub-limits. Meaning, they have a cap on the total coverage amount specifically mandated for certain diseases.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">For instance, cardiovascular diseases &mdash; They only pay &#8377;2,50,000</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">For knee replacements &mdash;&#8377;2,75,000</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">For other major operations like the one you just had &mdash; &#8377;2,00,000</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And finally, you realize how the company could offer you a &#8377;10 Lakh cover at such a low premium. They probably never end up paying the full cover amount in most cases.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t fall prey to this devious practice. Make sure you always know there are no disease wise sublimits. Because you don&rsquo;t know what will hit you. It&rsquo;s always prudent to pick a policy that has no such stipulations, after careful comparison among the best health insurance plans available in the market.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Seek Low Waiting Periods</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The scariest thing about insurance is the uncertainty involved in buying a policy - because the moment the sweet-talking concludes, the insurer will want to talk to you about your medical history. Do you have diabetes? Do you have any cardiovascular problems? Do you have thyroid-related illnesses? Or do you have any other pre-existing conditions? The list is endless.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Once they are through with that line of questioning, they might ask you to take a few medical tests. And based off of these reports, they will tell you that they will cover your hospitalization expense so long as it&#39;s not related to your pre-existing condition. But what happens if you are hospitalized for a complication arising out of a past condition? Well, in that case, they will ask you to wait for a while - maybe 2 to 4 years. And while it makes sense for the insurer to add this clause, it can be a particularly gruelling exercise for you.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">See the problem here is straightforward. Let&#39;s say you have problems with your blood pressure. You disclose this condition and then you buy your policy. Unfortunately, the very next year, you have a heart attack and you are desperately hoping your insurer will come through. However, it&#39;s quite possible that the insurer can deny your claim if they can connect your blood pressure disorder to the heart attack. So if an insurer makes you wait 4 years, you just have to hope and pray that you don&#39;t fall sick because of a pre-existing disease. And trust us, it&#39;s not a good place to be at.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Waiting periods are a common feature in most insurance policies. The only thing you can do is make sure you pick a policy that makes you wait the least amount of time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Opt for pre and post-hospitalization care</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You wake up one day and you start feeling dizzy. You consult your doctor. She prescribes a blood test. Nothing out of the ordinary, she says. So you go home with an ORS pack. But your condition deteriorates. You feel dizzy once again next evening. And this time the doctor prescribes an MRI. She checks the results and asks you to admit yourself to the hospital.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The doctor effectively treats your condition over the course of the next 3 days and you are discharged soon after.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The Hospital Bill adds up to &#8377;10,000</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The MRI and the diagnostic tests before hospitalization adds up to &#8377;15,000</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You are hoping your insurance covers both bills. But the company states they don&rsquo;t cover pre-hospitalization expenses. Meaning they won&rsquo;t cover all the costs you had to bear leading up to your hospitalization. Which is ironical because doctors often prescribe a host of diagnostic tests before they admit you to a hospital and sometimes even after they discharge you. And it can get quite expensive.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s always a good idea to pick a policy that covers both pre and post-hospitalization expenses. Say 30&ndash;60 days before and after you are treated in a hospital.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ask for restoration benefit</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a Sunday morning and you&rsquo;re sipping coffee on the hospital bed. You are thinking about how a small heart complication forced you into a 3-week stay at the hospital. More importantly, you&rsquo;re thinking about how you racked up a bill totaling &#8377;4,88,000. Thankfully, your insurance policy is going to take care of the burden. After all, you have a &#8377;5 Lakh cover. So you don&rsquo;t have to pay anything right now. But you start thinking about other possibilities.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">See, you bought a combined policy &mdash; For both your wife and yourself. And if she were to fall sick anytime soon, then the insurance won&rsquo;t cover her bills. You&rsquo;ve used up the benefits already.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But what if the insurance restored itself to the initial state immediately after you make a claim? What if your insurer offered you a &#8377;5 lakh cover once again in the event you or your wife have to be hospitalized anytime soon?</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well&hellip;Guess what? It&rsquo;s possible with a restoration benefit.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">While some policies offer unlimited restoration for any illness, others have some restrictions. For instance, some policies will tell you that you can&rsquo;t claim the restoration benefit if you have the same illness once again. In this case &mdash; a heart complication.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s always prudent to opt for restoration benefits if you have a combined policy. It also makes sense even if it&rsquo;s an individual policy. Just make sure you read the fine print on how the cover is restored each time and you&rsquo;ll be set.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Seek coverage for treatments that last &lt;24 hrs</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You are out playing a game of cards with your friends. Suddenly you feel a sharp twitch in your abdomen. It&#39;s odd, but these things keep happening to you all the time. So you don&#39;t pay a lot of attention. A few moments pass. and then suddenly the twitch is there again. This time it doesn&#39;t go away. Instead, within a moment the pain intensifies. Soon, it becomes unbearable. Your friends take you to the hospital. And after a quick inspection, the doctor breaks the news. It&#39;s appendicitis and they have to operate on you immediately.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But it&#39;s not that big of a deal. In fact, the doctor assures you that he&#39;ll discharge you the same day. And although you require some treatment, you walk out of the hospital within 24 hours. However, it&#39;s an expensive procedure. The bill adds up to &#8377;80,000 and you&#39;re gobsmacked. You call your insurer hoping they will cover these costs in full. And suddenly they break the news to you. They won&#39;t cover this.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You are incensed and you press for a clarification. The agent calms you down and walks you through the policy document once again - where they explicitly note how they don&#39;t cover daycare treatments. Or in other words, treatments that require hospitalization but those that last less than 24 hours. Think - Chemotherapy, Dialysis or in this case appendicitis.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Always prefer policies that cover daycare treatments. Because you never know when your appendix might put you in a soup.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Domiciliary Expense</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A deadly pandemic starts wreaking havoc. However, your job forces you to step out every day. And then suddenly, one day you wake up with a bad cold. You are coughing incessantly. You hope it&rsquo;ll go away on its own. But then you have trouble breathing. Your condition deteriorates and you are forced to call the emergency services. But they tell you they can&rsquo;t find a hospital bed. Your only choice is to obtain treatment at home. Some hospitals provide this facility. But it&#39;s going to cost you money. A lot of money!!!</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And then a ray of hope. Your insurer tells you they will cover your expenses since you are forced to be treated at home.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It could be because of a specific condition or because the hospital couldn&rsquo;t find you a bed &mdash; Like in this case. It&rsquo;s rare to be in such a spot. But you are glad you have this facility nonetheless.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Another good-to-have benefit. But in most cases, you don&rsquo;t have to go out of your way to find a policy that will cover domiciliary expenses.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Bonus in case you don&rsquo;t make a claim</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Insurers will tell you they want you to stay fit and healthy. In fact, they will even incentivize you in a bid to achieve this objective. For instance, how would you feel if somebody told you they&rsquo;ll up your cover (above and beyond the sum insured) by 50% each year in the event you don&rsquo;t claim insurance. That would be amazing, right?</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Think about it. You could start with a cover of &#8377;5 lakhs. And then see it move up to &#8377;7.5 lakhs and then the next year, another 50% over and the above the sum insured would take your total cover to 10 lakhs. Obviously, they&rsquo;ll stop at some point. Most insurance companies will tell you they&rsquo;ll stop once the cover doubles in value. In fact, they&rsquo;ll also tell you they&rsquo;ll cut the sum insured by the same amount (50%) in the event you claim insurance after receiving the bonus. So technically, next year, you could be back with a cover of just 5 lakhs.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But still, it&rsquo;s a pretty nifty bonus.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">No Claim Bonus is pretty useful. All you have to do is make sure that the bonus is actually substantial. For instance, anything below 10% is not really meaningful. So it might just be a marketing tactic.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Free health checkups every year</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&#39;s a lazy Saturday afternoon. You&#39;ve been waiting for almost an hour now and you can&#39;t help but look at the receptionist intently hoping he will call your name. And then suddenly when you least expect it, you hear your name called out loud. You walk into the doctor&#39;s room. She directs you to a certain spot and measures your height. She then checks your weight. She makes you sit straight and then takes your blood pressure. She listens to your heart and lungs and orders a blood test for cholesterol and blood sugar. And just before you leave, she offers some advice on how you can lower risks for diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. You get your reports the next day and everything is perfect. You don&#39;t need follow-up care. At least, not until next year.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">What you just had was a full body health checkup. And while some people might just ignore it altogether, it gives you a certain peace of mind. Now usually these health checkups can cost you anywhere between &#8377;1,000 and &#8377;1,500. And if you&#39;re fairly regular with these checkups, it&#39;s going to weigh on your pockets consistently.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Once again, we know it&#39;s not a lot of money. But it wouldn&#39;t hurt if you save on these costs entirely. And that&#39;s why some insurers will pay for your health checkups. Okay, maybe they won&#39;t do it every year. But even if they do it once in 2 years it&#39;s still an added bonus, right?</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">While it&rsquo;s not a deal-breaker, it is definitely nice to have a policy that offers you a free health checkup every year.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Cover for Alternative treatments</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;re pushing 50 and you feel drained each day. You go to your physician and he tells you there&rsquo;s nothing wrong. &ldquo;It could be stress&rdquo;, he exclaims. You are unsatisfied but you go home nonetheless. The next day however you bump into your neighbour. You start chatting and he suggests visiting a government certified Ayush Centre.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So you visit the facility and meet with the practitioners. They suggest getting an Ayurvedic Rejuvenation Therapy &mdash; Panchakarma. It&rsquo;s going to last 7&ndash;11 days and it&rsquo;s going to cost you &#8377;25,000. That&rsquo;s quite expensive you think. And then suddenly it hits, your health insurance policy covers Ayush treatments. So you sign off on the payment and get started immediately. Good thing, you remembered that little detail eh?</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ayush Coverage is a good-to-have feature. But remember, the policy will only cover these treatments so long as you&rsquo;re hospitalized in a government certified Ayush facility.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Maternity Benefits</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You are thinking of having kids. But you know you&#39;ll have to plan for it in advance. The first order of business is to make arrangements for childbirth - when you will have to visit the hospital and get the baby delivered. You know getting there won&#39;t be a problem, but the hospitalization could turn out to be an expensive affair. But what if you could offset this by opting for an insurance policy that covers this cost? It looks like a solid idea. But alas&hellip; This plan has some issues.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">For starters, the insurer knows for certain that they&#39;ll have to bear this expense in the event you decide to have kids. And since most people have at least one kid, the insurer will most likely have to pay up. So, many companies simply don&#39;t offer the benefit. The ones that do will make sure they are adequately compensated.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So they&#39;ll push the premiums way higher. Or they&#39;ll tell you they&#39;ll only cover a small part of the expense. Or sometimes, they&#39;ll only offer it in a family plan and make sure both you and your spouse are covered - in which case one of you is opting for the benefit even if you won&#39;t be hospitalized for a maternity-related matter.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is no free lunch in this world. And while it&#39;s all good if your insurer does cover this expense, make sure you don&#39;t end up paying ridiculously high premiums just to avail this benefit. It might not be worth it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When should you opt for OPD?</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Everybody visits the doctor at least once a year. But the doctor you visit &mdash; Her consultation fee is off the roof. A routine inspection could set you back thousands. So you come up with a genius plan. You decide to buy insurance and opt for a policy that reimburses all expenses incurred during these visits. You look for options that include outpatient consultation benefits and you find one after a couple of minutes of search.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You exclaim &mdash; &ldquo;Genius.&rdquo; And you give yourself a pat on the back.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But alas... Nothing in this godforsaken world is as it seems.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">For starters, the insurer knows for certain that they&rsquo;ll have to pay you something each year. Just ask yourself. Have you been to the doctor this year? Have you paid over &#8377;1,000 in consultation fee? Have you paid more? Do you think this trend is likely to change?</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Yeah... It&rsquo;s not going to change. So it&rsquo;s quite likely that the insurer will be forced to reimburse you some amount each year. And that&rsquo;s why many companies simply don&rsquo;t offer this benefit. The ones that do will make sure they are adequately compensated. So they&rsquo;ll push the premiums way higher. Or they&rsquo;ll tell you they&rsquo;ll only cover a small part of the expense.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is no free lunch in this world. And while OPD benefits look good on paper, it&#39;s possible that you&rsquo;ll actually end up paying more in premiums. Believe it or not, it might actually be more cost-effective to not opt for this benefit, in most cases.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c11" id="h.m15ffrfgs38x"><span class="c7">Health Insurance Checklist</span></h1><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This is a list of important policy features and it should give you an idea about what to expect from a decent health insurance policy</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Must have Features</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">1 Don&rsquo;t split the Bill</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Insurers might nudge you to consider a co-payment clause, in which case, you&rsquo;ll be forced to foot a part of the bill each time you make a claim. Could be 10%. Could be 20%. Could even be 30% of the bill. So opting to co-pay might not be the best option, unless you have no choice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">2 Restrictions on room &amp; room rent</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some insurers won&rsquo;t let you pick a room you like. Instead, they&rsquo;ll have a limit on room rent. And in the event, you breach this limit, they&rsquo;ll make you pay extra for every little service rendered in the room and not just the rent. At the end of it all, you&rsquo;ll end up paying a good portion of the bill. So opt for a policy that doesn&rsquo;t have too many restrictions on this front.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">3 Check for Disease Wise Sub-limits</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s what happens when the insurer offers you a massive cover (say 10 lakhs) for a modest fee, only to include restrictions on how much of this cover will be available for each disease. So, in effect, you&rsquo;ll likely end up having only a part of the 10 lakhs available in most cases.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">4 Opt for pre and post-hospitalization care</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nobody falls sick right off the bat. You&rsquo;ll likely have to go through a host of diagnostic tests before you&rsquo;re hospitalized. Once you&rsquo;re discharged you&rsquo;ll have to worry about medication. And these costs can add up.
